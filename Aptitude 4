Q: The monthly income of a person is 13,500, and his monthly expenditure is 9,000. Next year's income increased by 14%, and his expenditure increased by 7%. Find percent increase in his savings is?
Ans:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

Current situation:

Monthly income: ₹13,500
Monthly expenditure: ₹9,000
Monthly savings: ₹13,500 - ₹9,000 = ₹4,500

Next year's situation:

Monthly income increased by 14%: ₹13,500 × 1.14 = ₹15,390
Monthly expenditure increased by 7%: ₹9,000 × 1.07 = ₹9,630
Monthly savings: ₹15,390 - ₹9,630 = ₹5,760

Percent increase in savings:

Increase in savings: ₹5,760 - ₹4,500 = ₹1,260
Percent increase: (₹1,260 / ₹4,500) × 100% ≈ 28%

So, the percent increase in his savings is approximately 28%.
