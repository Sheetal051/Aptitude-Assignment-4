Q: 49 pumps can empty a tank in 10 days, working 10 hours a day. if 70 pumps are used for 7 hours each day then in how many days the tank can be emptied?
Ans:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

Original situation:

49 pumps can empty the tank in 10 days
Working 10 hours a day, so total hours worked = 10 days × 10 hours/day = 100 hours
Total work done by 49 pumps in 100 hours = 1 tank

Work done by 1 pump in 1 hour:

Total work done by 49 pumps in 100 hours = 1 tank
Work done by 1 pump in 100 hours = 1 tank / 49 pumps = 1/49 tank
Work done by 1 pump in 1 hour = (1/49 tank) / 100 hours = 1/4900 tank/hour

New situation:

70 pumps are used
Working 7 hours a day
Total hours worked per day = 7 hours
Total work done by 70 pumps in 1 day = 70 pumps × (1/4900 tank/hour) × 7 hours = 70/700 tank/day = 1/10 tank/day

Days required to empty the tank:

Total work done by 70 pumps in 1 day = 1/10 tank/day
Days required to empty the tank = 1 tank / (1/10 tank/day) = 10 days

So, the tank can be emptied in 10 days
